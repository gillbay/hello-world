# hello-world
My first repository

I have some old skills I'm wanting to re-kindle as well as learn some new stuff.
I also manage a bunch of guys who know way more than me so I would like to catch up a bit.
And if this can be part of my model railroad or wood making hobby, then that would be cool.
Oh, and I like to cook - so creating a cookbook is a priority.
